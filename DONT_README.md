Welcome to my cool cartography catalog where my amateaur cart projects sit to rot. Every day they waste my time and I never get better. They are a huge source of stress for me. Like, the stress you feel in your left arm when the entire thing goes numb. come on, get moving.. type dammit. 
Anyway
As I was saying. Welcome, watch your step, don't trip. I have uploaded a few pieces of work here for you to evalute my professionalism, but deep down I think we all know it's the map's own fault for being ugly. 

I am most interested in social issues, where people are, where "people" are.. sociology, that stuff. I work currently for a Civil Rights Organization, probably one of the last really good things I'll ever do for society before I drop off the deep end and start working on scummy Big Contractor corporation and my rotten soul and collection of maps will feed my garden.

I live in Richmond, Va and sometimes Washington, DC and sometimes I forget in which place I am. That's the thing about depression for me, I just < slip > on in from one slimey mindset to another. 

Like I said, this reposity (?) has soome maps indicative of my cartographic "syle," and color preferences, and a few examples here lay that demonstrate my ability to follow a school assignment step by step like a gerbil. But the really bad ones there, yeah those grey, brown, bleh, sickening maps.. Yes those are my worst and those are what happens when I'm unsupervised! I tell you, I turn those things in for work and they still haven't fired my asss. Yes those bad boys should never see the lights of a laser printer. Shield your eyes.

But I believe in myself.
